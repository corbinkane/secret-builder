create a random password generator using what we have learned in class

## Description
A lot of people reuse the same password over and over again for a lot of different accounts. As you can imagine this is can lead to multiple accounts getting hacked at once. Thats where this project comes into the picture, this web application is a random password generator. You can create your own randomly generated password to your specifications as in how long and the tpe of characters to be used.

This application was built using HTML, CSS AND JavaScript in order to provide you with a new and uinque password everytime

I was able to learn some basic fundamental to JavaScript and put that knowledge to the test while building this application

## Usage
