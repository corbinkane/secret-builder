create a random password generator using waht we have leaned in class

## Description
The what? In this project we created a random password generator to be used as a quick and easy way to acquire a random password built to your specfications

The why? Making a new and secure password is tough and often times I find myself reusing the same password very unsecure with this application now you can have a new and fresh password at your fingertips instantly

the how? This application was built using HTML, CSS AND JavaScript in order to provide you with a new and uinque password everytime

I was able to learn some basic fundamental to JavaScript and put that knowledge to the test while building this application
